## 🚀 Hack the Planet. Reprogram the World.

My interests span from cybersecurity and ethical hacking to full-stack development and cloud computing. When I'm not coding, you might find me 🐛 hunting for vulnerabilities on platforms like [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/redyetihacks) or [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/profile/RedYetiDev/). You can find some of my Hall of Fames on my [LinkedIn Featured Page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/redyetidev/details/featured/).
